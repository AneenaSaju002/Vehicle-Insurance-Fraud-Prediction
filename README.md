# Vehicle-Insurance-Fraud-Prediction
Insurance fraud is a significant challenge, costing billions globally. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify fraudulent claims, helping insurance companies detect fraud more efficiently using classification models.
Key Steps in the Project:

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzed data distribution, trends, and relationships.

✅ Outlier Detection & Handling – Identified outliers and applied Winsorization to mitigate their impact.

✅ Feature Selection – Used SelectKBest with F-classif to pick the most relevant features for prediction.

✅ Model Building & Evaluation – Implemented various machine learning models, including: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Support Vector Classifier (SVC),Naïve Bayes,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Gradient Boosting,StackingClassifier, XGBoost

Top Performing Models:
Gradient Boosting & XGBoost emerged as the best-performing models, providing high accuracy and robustness in detecting fraudulent claims.
